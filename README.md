My first React project. It started as a vanilla Javascript project which then got ported to React.

Tools I came out with after finishing this project: 

  -> The use of useState and useEffect
 
  -> The understanding of reflow
  
  -> Working with and understanding JSX in React
  
  -> Designing for mobile first

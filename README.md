 A simple rock paper scissors app made in React. My first React project. It was first made in vanilla Javascript and then ported to React.

Tools that i came out with after finishing this project:
	
	-> The use of useState and useEffect
	
	-> The understanding of reflow
	
	-> The use of JSX in React
	
	-> Designed for mobile first

My first React project. It started as a vanilla Javascript project which then got ported to React.

Tools I aquired during this project: 

    -> The use of useState and useEffect
 
    -> The understanding of reflow
  
    -> Working with and understanding JSX in React
  
    -> Designing for mobile first
